      Welcome to the Chemistry Lab!
    </h2>
    <div class="text-slate-300 space-y-3">
      <p>
        In this lab, we're not just mixing chemicals; we're exploring the core principles of modern web development. Think of your web browser as a high-tech laboratory and HTMX as your set of advanced instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every action you take—like mixing chemicals with <strong>`hx-post`</strong>—is an experiment. The server processes your request and sends back a result, just like a chemical reaction. When the beaker is <strong>bubbling</strong>, it's our visual indicator that a request is in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, a reaction triggers a lab-wide alert (an <strong>`HX-Trigger`</strong> header), or a sensitive monitor needs to be checked constantly (<strong>polling</strong>). This lesson will show you how HTMX makes these complex, asynchronous interactions feel simple, precise, and powerful.
