# This file defines the core FastAPI application, its state, and API endpoints.

# easily testable service that strictly adheres to the defined API contract.

# Instantiate the FastAPI application. This is the central object that will
# manage all our API routes.

# the initial UI and dynamic HTML fragments. The directory is specified relative
# to the project root.

# --- In-Memory State Management ---

# Per the project scope, we use a simple in-memory dictionary for our application
# state. This is not suitable for production but is ideal for this educational
# context to keep the focus on the API and HTMX interaction.
# We initialize the state with a default temperature.
