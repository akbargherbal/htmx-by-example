# This file contains the API-level tests for our FastAPI application.
# The goal is to verify that each endpoint strictly conforms to the API contract
# regarding status codes, headers, and response bodies. We use FastAPI's TestClient
# for this purpose, as it provides a direct and efficient way to test the app
# without a running server.

# This pytest fixture is decorated with `autouse=True`, which means it will
# automatically run before every single test function in this file.
# This is the cornerstone of test isolation, ensuring no state leaks between tests.
