[pytest]
# This configuration is essential for running tests in a structured project.
# It tells pytest to add the project's root directory (.) to Python's import path.
# Without this, `from app.main import app` in `tests/test_api.py` would fail
# because Python wouldn't know where to find the 'app' module.
