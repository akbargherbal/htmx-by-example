          <strong>The Problem:</strong> To fetch simple content (like our "Soup of the Day") and display it without a full page reload, you'd traditionally need to write JavaScript. This involves using the `fetch()` API, handling Promises, waiting for the response, and then manually finding the target element in the DOM to update its `innerHTML`. This is a multi-step, boilerplate-heavy process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The HTMX Solution:</strong> HTMX boils this entire process down to a single HTML attribute. `hx-get="/menu-item?name=soup"` tells the browser: "When this button is clicked, send a GET request to this URL." The server responds with an HTML snippet, and HTMX automatically handles the rest, placing the content exactly where you tell it to with `hx-target`.

        <span>Why use `hx-post` on a form?</span>
        <span
          class="text-slate-500 text-sm transform transition-transform"
          :class="{ 'rotate-180': openAccordion === 2 }"

          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Handling form submissions asynchronously is even more complex. You must write JavaScript to prevent the form's default full-page submission, manually collect data from all inputs (including tricky cases like multiple checkboxes), package it for the request body, make a `fetch()` call with the `POST` method, and then process the response to update the UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The HTMX Solution:</strong> Adding `hx-post="/custom-order"` to a `<form>` tag is a game-changer. HTMX automatically intercepts the submission, serializes all the form's data (including the `toppings` checkboxes and `special_requests` input), and sends it in the request body. It completely eliminates the need for custom form-handling JavaScript.

          <strong>The Problem:</strong> In a typical JavaScript application, the logic that triggers an action (e.g., a button's `onclick` listener) is often separate from the logic that updates the UI. You have to write code to explicitly select the destination element, like `document.getElementById('plate-display-area')`, making the data flow harder to trace.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The HTMX Solution:</strong> `hx-target="#plate-display-area"` makes the data flow declarative and obvious. It co-locates the "what to do" (`hx-get`) with the "where to put it" (`hx-target`). By simply reading the HTML of the button or form, you know exactly which part of the page will be updated, making the code much easier to read, understand, and maintain.
