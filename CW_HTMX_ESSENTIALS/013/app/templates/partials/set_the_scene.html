      Welcome to the Classic Diner!
    </h2>
    <div class="text-slate-300 space-y-3">
      <p>
        Imagine you're sitting in a cozy booth at a classic 24-hour diner. The menu is in front of you, and the kitchen is ready to cook. This familiar experience is the perfect analogy for how HTMX works.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you point to an item on the menu like "Soup of the Day" and tell the waiter, you're making a simple, direct request. This is like an HTMX <strong>`GET`</strong> request. The waiter (HTMX) takes your order to the kitchen (the server), which prepares the soup and brings it directly to your table (the target element on your screen). No need to get a whole new table for just a bowl of soup!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, what if you want to "Build-a-Burger"? You fill out a small form with your specific choices: toppings, special requests, etc. This is like an HTMX <strong>`POST`</strong> request. You're sending detailed information to the kitchen. The kitchen then uses your custom data to prepare the perfect burger and deliver it to your plate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lesson, you'll see how HTMX makes web interactions as intuitive as ordering a meal, replacing complex JavaScript with simple HTML attributes.
