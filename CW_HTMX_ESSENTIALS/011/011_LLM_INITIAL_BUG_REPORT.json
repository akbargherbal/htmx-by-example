    "classification": "CASCADE_BUG",
    "confidence_score": 1.0,
    "summary": "The project exhibits a 90% test failure rate due to a classic cascade bug. The root cause is that the FastAPI application attempts to render several HTML partial templates (e.g., `_inventory_list.html`, `_equipped_item.html`) that are missing from the `app/templates` directory. This single issue causes all API endpoints responsible for returning HTML fragments to fail with a `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound` error, leading to 500 Internal Server Errors. Consequently, all E2E tests that simulate user interactions fail because the UI does not update as expected. The application's core logic and the tests themselves are well-designed; the failure is due to missing project assets.",

        "design_flaw_analysis": {
            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The foundation is solid. The project's concept of using a video game inventory to teach HTMX CRUD operations via partial HTML rendering is logical, educationally sound, and correctly implemented in principle within the existing code. There are no signs of hallucinated logic or dependencies."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The tests are well-designed and follow modern best practices. The API tests correctly use FastAPI's TestClient and make specific assertions. The E2E tests are robust, utilizing `data-testid` selectors to avoid brittleness and Playwright's `expect` for reliable, auto-waiting assertions. The fact that the tests correctly fail when the backend returns an error demonstrates their effectiveness."
        },
        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The primary issue is that multiple FastAPI endpoints attempt to render Jinja2 templates that do not exist in the provided project structure. The application logic calls for templates like `_inventory_list.html`, `_equipped_item.html`, and `_treasure_chest.html`, but these files are missing from the `app/templates/` directory.",
            "evidence": "The pytest log consistently shows `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound` for every API test that interacts with a fragment-returning endpoint. For example: `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: '_inventory_list.html' not found in search path: 'app/templates'`. This server-side error directly causes the subsequent E2E test failures, such as `AssertionError: Locator expected to be visible` when a new item fails to be rendered."

        "next_step": "FIX_BUGS",
        "justification": "The core application logic and the test suite are both sound. The problem is not conceptual but a simple case of missing files. The fix is to create the required HTML partial templates. Once these assets are in place, the application should function as designed, and the well-written test suite should pass."
