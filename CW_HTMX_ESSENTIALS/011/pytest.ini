[pytest]
# Principal Engineer's Note:
# This configuration is essential for a clean project structure.
# It tells pytest to add the project's root directory (.) to the Python path.
# This allows tests in the `tests/` directory to import modules from the `app/`
# directory (e.g., `from app.main import app`) without complex relative path hacks.
# It's a simple but powerful setting for maintainability.
