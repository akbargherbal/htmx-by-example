[pytest]
# This configuration is essential for running tests from the project's root directory.
# `pythonpath = .` tells pytest to add the root directory to Python's path.
# This allows test files in `tests/` to correctly import application modules
# from `app/` using absolute paths, e.g., `from app.main import app`.
# It's a clean and standard way to structure a testable Python project.
pythonpath = .
