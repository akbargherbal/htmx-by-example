[pytest]
# This configuration is essential for making pytest run correctly from the
# project's root directory.
# `pythonpath = .` tells pytest to add the current directory (.) to Python's
# path. This allows test files like `tests/test_api.py` to successfully
# import modules from the `app` directory, for example: `from app.main import app`.
pythonpath = .
