    "summary": "The project is fundamentally sound, and both the application code and test suite are well-designed. The high failure rate in the E2E tests is caused by a single, specific bug in the frontend. The `index.html` file incorrectly assumes that HTMX will automatically swap the content of 4xx error responses into the DOM. In reality, this requires explicit event handling. This omission causes all E2E tests that verify error message display to fail, creating a cascading effect from a single point of failure.",

            "justification": "The project's educational concept and implementation are solid. It correctly sets up distinct backend endpoints to demonstrate various HTTP responses (200, 403, 404, 409, 200 with HX-Redirect) and maps them to frontend interactions, which is an excellent way to teach advanced HTMX error handling and navigation."

            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The test suite is of high quality. The API tests (`test_api.py`) correctly use FastAPI's TestClient and fixtures for isolated, repeatable testing. The E2E tests (`test_e2e.py`) are robust, using `data-testid` selectors to avoid brittleness and Playwright's `expect` for reliable, auto-waiting assertions. The tests are successfully and correctly identifying a real bug in the application's behavior."

        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The root cause is the frontend's failure to handle the `htmx:responseError` event. The API tests confirm the backend correctly sends HTML fragments with 4xx status codes. However, the E2E tests fail because the frontend (`index.html`) lacks the necessary HTMX configuration to process these error responses and swap their content into the page. The passing E2E tests for 2xx responses confirm the basic HTMX setup is correct, isolating the problem to error handling.",
            "evidence": "All API tests pass, proving the backend is correct. All E2E tests for 2xx responses pass. The failures are isolated to E2E tests expecting UI updates from 4xx responses. The log shows a consistent pattern: `AssertionError: Locator expected to be visible` followed by `Actual value: <element(s) not found>`. For example: `waiting for get_by_test_id(\"records-result-target\").get_by_test_id(\"records-result-target-after-403\")`. This proves the error content, which the API test confirms was sent, never made it into the DOM."

A single, targeted fix in `index.html` to properly handle the `htmx:responseError` event will resolve all test failures. The project is valuable and only requires this minor correction."
