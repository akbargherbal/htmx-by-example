# This configuration file is for pytest.
# The `pythonpath` setting is crucial for ensuring that our test runner
# can correctly locate and import modules from our application, such as `app.main`.
# By setting it to '.', we tell pytest to add the project's root directory
# to Python's import path, resolving potential `ModuleNotFoundError` issues.
