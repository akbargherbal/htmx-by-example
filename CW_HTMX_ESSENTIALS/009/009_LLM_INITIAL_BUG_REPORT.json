    "summary": "The project's code and tests are both conceptually sound and well-designed. The test failures are not due to a fundamental design flaw or faulty tests, but rather a small set of specific, minor bugs within the application's implementation. One bug is in the Python backend's HTML generation logic (a button is missing the `disabled` attribute), and the other is a typo in an HTMX attribute in the HTML template (`hx-on::` instead of `hx-on:`), which breaks the global error handling. The high-quality tests have correctly identified these application bugs.",

            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The foundation of the application (a vending machine demonstrating OOB swaps and error handling) is conceptually solid and well-implemented. The FastAPI backend and HTMX frontend are logically structured and represent a valid educational example. The only flaw is an external metadata mismatch where the courseware description (Airport Terminal) does not match the codebase (Vending Machine), but the code itself is not fundamentally flawed."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The tests are of high quality. The API tests correctly use FastAPI's TestClient and state-resetting fixtures for isolated, reliable contract testing. The E2E tests are robust, using `data-testid` selectors to avoid brittleness and Playwright's `expect()` for reliable, auto-waiting assertions. The tests correctly diagnose the application's failures without being faulty themselves."

        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "There are two distinct, minor bugs in the application code. 1) In `main.py`, the HTML for an unaffordable item's button is generated without the `disabled` attribute, causing the `test_initial_state_is_correct` to fail. 2) In `templates/index.html`, the global error handler uses an incorrect attribute `hx-on::htmx:responseError` instead of the correct `hx-on:htmx:responseError`, causing the `test_purchase_sold_out_item_shows_error_on_screen` to fail as the handler never executes.",
            "evidence": "Failure 1: `AssertionError: Locator expected to be disabled\nActual value: enabled` for locator `item_selection_button-D4-unaffordable`. Failure 2: `AssertionError: Locator expected to contain text 'SOLD OUT'\nActual value: \nWelcome! Select an item for info.` for locator `display_screen_target` after triggering a 404 error."

Fixing the two identified minor bugs (adding the `disabled` attribute in `main.py` and correcting the `hx-on:` attribute in `index.html`) will resolve the test failures and make the courseware fully functional."
