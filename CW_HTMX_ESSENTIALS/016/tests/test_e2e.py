# Principal Engineer Note:
# This E2E test suite uses Playwright to validate the complete user journey.
# The tests are written from the user's perspective, interacting with the browser
# and asserting that the UI updates as expected after HTMX requests.
# Adherence to the `data-testid` convention is non-negotiable for creating
# robust tests that are decoupled from fragile CSS selectors or text content.
