# This file defines the main FastAPI application, its endpoints, and state management.
# As a Principal Engineer, I emphasize clear separation of concerns. Here, we define
# data (HTML fragments) separately from the routing logic for maintainability.

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates

# --- Application Setup ---

# Instantiate the FastAPI application. This is the core of our API.
app = FastAPI()

# Configure Jinja2 for server-side HTML rendering. The 'app/templates' directory
# is the standard location for web templates.
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="app/templates")


# --- In-Memory Data & State Management ---

# For this educational project, we define the HTML fragments directly in code.
# In a real-world application, these would likely be generated from a database
# and rendered through more complex templates, but this approach is perfect
# for isolating the HTMX-specific backend logic we want to demonstrate.
