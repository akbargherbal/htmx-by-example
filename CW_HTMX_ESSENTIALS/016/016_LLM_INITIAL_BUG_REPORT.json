    "classification": "FAULTY_TESTS",
    "confidence_score": 0.9,
    "summary": "The project fails two tests for two independent reasons, not a single cascading failure. The primary classification is FAULTY_TESTS because at least one test contains a critical bug, failing on correct application behavior due to a brittle assertion. A second, unrelated bug exists in the application's initial HTML state, causing a well-designed E2E test to fail its precondition check. The presence of a clear bug within the test suite itself makes 'Faulty Tests' the most accurate diagnosis.",
    "analysis": {
        "design_flaw_analysis": {
            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The core educational concept of demonstrating `hx-boost` and `hx-indicator` in an e-commerce context is sound and well-implemented. The FastAPI backend and HTMX frontend code are logical, clean, and work together correctly. The mismatch with the courseware description appears to be a metadata error, not a flaw in the implemented project itself."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": false,
            "justification": "The test suite quality is inconsistent. While it correctly uses modern practices like `data-testid` selectors, FastAPI's TestClient, and fixtures, it contains a significant flaw. The API test `test_get_root_serves_main_html_page` uses a brittle string assertion (`assert '<html>' in response.text`) that fails on valid HTML (`<html lang=\"en\">`). This type of error undermines the reliability of the entire test suite, as it produces false negatives."

        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The test failures stem from two independent issues. The first is a faulty test: `test_get_root_serves_main_html_page` uses a brittle assertion that fails on valid HTML. The second is a bug in the application's initial state: the loading indicator is visible on page load, which correctly causes the E2E test `test_clicking_place_order_shows_success_message` to fail its precondition check.",
            "evidence": "Faulty Test Evidence: `FAILED tests/test_api.py::test_get_root_serves_main_html_page - assert '<html>' in '...<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\"en\">...'`. Application Bug Evidence: `FAILED tests/test_e2e.py::test_clicking_place_order_shows_success_message[chromium] - AssertionError: Locator expected not to be visible. Actual value: visible`."

        "justification": "The project is conceptually sound and the tests are mostly well-structured. The next step should be to fix both identified bugs: 1) Correct the brittle assertion in `test_api.py`. 2) Fix the initial visibility of the loading indicator in `index.html`. These are minor fixes that should result in a fully passing and reliable test suite."
