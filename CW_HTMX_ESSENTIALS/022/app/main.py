# This file defines the main FastAPI application for the Community Garden.
# It handles all API logic, state management, and serves the initial HTML page.
# As a Principal Engineer, I've designed this to be simple, self-contained, and
# easily testable, which is ideal for this educational project.

# directory where index.html will be located.

# --- State Management ---

# For this educational project, we use a simple in-memory dictionary for state.
# This avoids the complexity of a database, keeping the focus on HTMX and API interactions.
# The state is a dictionary representing the garden plots. Keys are plot IDs (int),
# and values are the names of the plants (str).
# We also track the next available plot ID to ensure uniqueness.
