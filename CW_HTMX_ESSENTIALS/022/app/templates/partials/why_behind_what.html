          <strong>The Problem:</strong> To add a new item to a list from a form without a full page reload, you traditionally need to write a lot of JavaScript. This involves capturing the form's `submit` event, preventing its default behavior, using `fetch()` to send the data to the server, waiting for the response, and then manually creating and appending a new element to the DOM. This is repetitive boilerplate code for a very common pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The HTMX Solution:</strong> HTMX turns this multi-step JavaScript process into a few declarative HTML attributes. In our "Garden Tools" form, `hx-post` tells HTMX where to send the data, `hx-target` specifies which container should receive the response, and `hx-swap="beforeend"` instructs it to append the new plant at the end of the container. The server simply returns the HTML for the new item, and HTMX handles the rest.

        <span>Why use `hx-put` & `hx-delete` to manage list items?</span>

          <strong>The Problem:</strong> When updating or deleting a specific item in a list, you need to identify that item in the DOM and then either replace it or remove it. In JavaScript, this means finding the element (e.g., with `document.getElementById()`), then using `.innerHTML` to replace it or `.remove()` to delete it. This logic is separate from the button that triggered it, making the code harder to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The HTMX Solution:</strong> HTMX co-locates the action with the trigger. The "Replace" button uses `hx-put` and `hx-target="#plot-123"` to target its own container. The server returns the updated HTML for that plot, and `hx-swap="outerHTML"` replaces the old element with the new one. Similarly, the "Pull Weed" button uses `hx-delete`. When the server returns a successful (200 OK) response, HTMX knows to remove the targeted element from the DOM automatically.

        <span>Why use `hx-trigger="every..."` for polling?</span>

          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Creating a UI component that automatically refreshes with new data (like a status panel or notification feed) typically requires JavaScript's `setInterval()`. You have to write a function that makes a `fetch()` request, updates the DOM, and handles potential errors, all within a timed loop that you must manage manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The HTMX Solution:</strong> HTMX provides a purely declarative way to do this. The "Garden Status Panel" uses `hx-get="/garden/status"` to define what data to fetch and `hx-trigger="load, every 3s"` to define when. This single attribute tells HTMX to make the request once on page load and then repeat it every 3 seconds, replacing the content of the div with the server's response. It's a simple, powerful, and highly readable way to create live UI.
