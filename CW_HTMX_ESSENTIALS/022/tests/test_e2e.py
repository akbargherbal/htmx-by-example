# Principal Frontend Engineer's Notes:
#
# This E2E test suite uses Playwright to verify the complete user workflow. My philosophy
# for E2E tests is to simulate a user's journey as closely as possible and assert on the
# final, visible outcomes. This test validates the entire system: the browser, HTMX,
# and the FastAPI backend, all working together.
#
# Key Testing Strategies:
# 1.  Test the Full Flow: Instead of many small tests, one comprehensive test function,
#     `test_full_garden_crud_and_polling_workflow`, covers the entire "happy path"
#     (Create, Replace, Delete, and Polling). This mirrors how a user would interact
#     with the page and provides high value by testing the integration of all features.
#
# 2.  `data-testid` Selectors: All element selections use `page.get_by_test_id()`. This is
#     the most robust strategy, as it decouples tests from fragile selectors like CSS
#     classes or text content, which are likely to change.
#
# 3.  Playwright's `expect` and Auto-Waiting: I exclusively use `expect()` for assertions.
#     Its built-in auto-waiting mechanism is essential for testing dynamic applications.
#     For example, when we check for the "Garden is Thriving" status, `expect()` will
#     automatically wait for the polling request to complete and the DOM to update. This
#     eliminates the need for unreliable `time.sleep()` calls.
#
# 4.  Asserting on Backend Truth: The assertions check for the *exact* HTML fragments
#     and states that the backend (`app/main.py`) is known to produce. For instance, we
#     assert that the "Tomato" plot is replaced by a "Carrot" plot, which is the specific
#     logic implemented in the `replace_plant` endpoint. This ensures our frontend and
#     backend are perfectly in sync.
