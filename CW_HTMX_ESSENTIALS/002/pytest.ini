[pytest]
# This configuration tells pytest to add the project's root directory
# to the Python path. This is crucial because it allows our test files
# (like tests/test_api.py) to correctly import modules from our application
# directory (e.g., `from app.main import app`). Without this, pytest would
# raise an `ImportError`.
