    "classification": "CASCADE_BUG",
    "confidence_score": 1.0,
    "summary": "The project is conceptually sound with a high-quality, robust test suite. The single test failure is caused by a subtle but critical bug in one FastAPI endpoint. The `/cue/special-effects` endpoint incorrectly sets a response header, causing it to be omitted when run on a live server. This prevents the `HX-Trigger` functionality from working, leading to the E2E test failure. The corresponding API test provides a false positive, highlighting the value of the comprehensive E2E test that caught the issue.",

            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The project's foundation is solid. The 'Stage Manager' theme is a coherent and effective way to teach the intended HTMX concepts (`hx-swap`, `hx-select`, `HX-Trigger`). The implementation uses standard, correct FastAPI and HTMX patterns without any signs of hallucination or conceptual errors."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The tests are exceptionally well-designed. They correctly use FastAPI's TestClient, pytest fixtures for state management, and Playwright best practices for E2E testing, such as relying on `data-testid` selectors and `expect()` for reliable, non-flaky assertions. The E2E test suite proved its value by catching a subtle bug that the API test suite missed, demonstrating a well-layered testing strategy. The only minor flaw is that the API test for `/cue/special-effects` gives a false positive, likely due to differences in how `TestClient` and a live server handle response objects."
        },
        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The root cause is a bug in the `cue_special_effects` endpoint in `app/main.py`. The function modifies the headers of a dependency-injected `response` object but then returns a raw string. FastAPI creates a new `Response` object from this string, discarding the modified one with the `HX-Trigger` header. This bug only manifests under the real `uvicorn` server used by E2E tests, not the in-process `TestClient` used by the API tests, which is why the API test passed but the E2E test failed.",
            "evidence": "The key evidence is the discrepancy between the passing API test and the failing E2E test for the same feature. The E2E test log shows the client-side effect did not happen: 'AssertionError: Locator expected to have text '\\u26a1 FLASHING \\u26a1'\\nE       Actual value: -- IDLE --'. This proves the `HX-Trigger` header was not received by the browser, despite the API test passing."

        "next_step": "FIX_BUGS",
        "justification": "The project is high-quality and the tests are well-structured. The issue is a single, isolated bug in the application code. Fixing the `/cue/special-effects` endpoint in `main.py` to explicitly construct and return an `HTMLResponse` with the required headers will resolve the test failure and complete this otherwise excellent courseware."
