      Welcome to the Vintage Mailroom Workspace!
    </h2>
    <div class="text-slate-300 space-y-3">
      <p>
        Imagine you're a clerk in a bustling, old-fashioned office mailroom. Your job is to handle inter-office memos. Every button click is like sending a request to a different department.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, your request is for a file that simply doesn't exist (a <strong>404 Not Found</strong> error). Other times, you might try to contact a department that's unexpectedly closed for the day (a <strong>500 Server Error</strong>). And occasionally, a department moves, so your mail must be automatically rerouted to the new address (an <strong>HX-Redirect</strong>).
      </p>
      <p>
        This lesson explores how HTMX, like a seasoned mailroom supervisor, expertly handles all these scenarios—lost mail, closed offices, and address changes—ensuring the right message gets to the right place, or that you're properly notified when it can't.
