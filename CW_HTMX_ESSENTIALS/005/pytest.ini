[pytest]
# This configuration is essential for running tests from the project root.
# It tells pytest to add the current directory ('.') to Python's path.
# This allows test files, like 'tests/test_api.py', to successfully
# import modules from the application directory, for example:
# `from app.main import app`. Without this, pytest would raise an ImportError.
