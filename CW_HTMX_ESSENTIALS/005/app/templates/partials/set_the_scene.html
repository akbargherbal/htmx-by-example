      Welcome to the Interactive LEGO Assembly Workshop!
    </h2>

      <p>
        Imagine you have a giant box of LEGO bricks. Your goal is to build a cool creation on your baseplate. The traditional way of building a web page is like taking your entire creation apart and rebuilding it from scratch every time you want to change just one single brick. It's slow and inefficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTMX changes the game. Think of HTMX as a set of magic instructions. Instead of rebuilding everything, you can simply point to a brick on your model (like a solid wall) and say, "Swap this for a window piece." The server—your box of bricks—sends you just the window piece, and it magically snaps into place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lesson, you'll be the master builder. You'll use HTMX to swap parts, add new bricks, and even pull a specific, rare piece (a drawbridge!) from a completely different instruction manual. Let's start building!
