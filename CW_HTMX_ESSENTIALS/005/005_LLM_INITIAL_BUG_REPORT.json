    "classification": "CASCADE_BUG",
    "confidence_score": 1.0,
    "summary": "The project fails its single E2E test due to a minor but critical bug in the `index.html` template. A comment within the template contains the character sequence `{{ ... }}`, which the Jinja2 templating engine incorrectly interprets as an expression to be evaluated. This causes a `TemplateSyntaxError`, preventing the main page from rendering and leading to a 500 Internal Server Error. Consequently, the E2E test cannot find any expected elements on the page and fails. The backend API, the tests themselves, and the overall educational concept are all sound.",

        "design_flaw_analysis": {
            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The project's foundation is solid. The educational goal of teaching `hx-swap` and `hx-select` via a LEGO builder is clear, logical, and well-implemented in both the FastAPI backend and the HTMX frontend. The code is clean and directly supports the lesson's objectives without any conceptual flaws or hallucinations."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The test suite is of high quality. The API tests (`test_api.py`) correctly use FastAPI's `TestClient` and make robust, specific assertions without being brittle. The E2E test (`test_e2e.py`) follows best practices by using `data-testid` selectors for resilience and Playwright's `expect()` for handling asynchronous updates, correctly verifying the application's state after each user action."

        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The root cause is a `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError` in `app/templates/index.html`. The string `{{ ... }}` inside an HTML comment is parsed by Jinja2, causing a fatal rendering error for the root endpoint ('/'). This results in a 500 Internal Server Error, which makes the E2E test fail on its initial assertion because the page content is never loaded.",
            "evidence": "The pytest log provides a definitive traceback:\n\nFile \"app\\templates\\index.html\", line 37, in template\n    static HTML. Therefore, no Jinja2 templating (`{{ ... }}`) is required in this file.\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\njinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: unexpected '.'"

        "justification": "The core application logic and the test suite are both well-designed. The project is failing due to a single, easily correctable bug. Fixing the `TemplateSyntaxError` in `index.html` (e.g., by escaping the curly braces or rephrasing the comment) should resolve the E2E test failure and make the project fully functional."
