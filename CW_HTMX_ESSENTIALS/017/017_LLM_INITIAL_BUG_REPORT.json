    "classification": "CASCADE_BUG",

    "summary": "The project fails all tests due to a single, critical `ImportError` in the main FastAPI application file (`app/main.py`). The `HTMLResponse` class is incorrectly imported from the `fastapi` package instead of `fastapi.responses`. This error occurs during test collection, preventing any tests from running and resulting in a 100% failure rate. The underlying application logic and the tests themselves are well-designed, making this a classic cascade bug.",

The E2E tests use modern best practices like `data-testid` selectors and Playwright's auto-waiting `expect` calls, making them robust and non-brittle. They accurately test the application's intended functionality."

The application attempts to import `HTMLResponse` from the top-level `fastapi` package, but it resides in `fastapi.responses`. This error occurs when pytest tries to load `conftest.py`, which imports the application, causing the entire test run to abort before any tests are collected or executed.",
