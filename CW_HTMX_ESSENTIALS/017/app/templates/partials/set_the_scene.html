      Welcome to the Dynamic News Broadcast Studio Interface!
    </h2>
    <div class="text-slate-300 space-y-3">
      <p>
        Imagine you're the director in a live news broadcast control room. Your screen is filled with monitors, each displaying critical information: the main "on-air" story, a scrolling news ticker, and a sidebar of incoming alerts from your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lesson, your webpage is that control room. We'll explore how HTMX can manage this complex, real-time environment. You'll see how to automatically refresh the news ticker (Polling), how one action can trigger updates across the studio (Server-Sent Events), and how a single command from the server can update multiple screens at once (Out-of-Band Swaps).
      </p>
      <p>
        Get ready to take control and see how simple, declarative attributes can orchestrate a dynamic, responsive user experience, just like a professional broadcast.
