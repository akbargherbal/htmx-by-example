    "summary": "The project's test failures are entirely due to poorly written API tests, not flaws in the application code. The application itself is well-designed and functionally correct, a fact confirmed by the 100% pass rate of the robust End-to-End (E2E) test suite. The failures are isolated to `test_api.py`, where assertions are overly brittle, failing on minor and irrelevant differences like HTML attributes and character encoding. The core application logic is sound, and the educational goals are met.",

            "justification": "The test suite is of mixed quality. The E2E tests (`test_e2e.py`) are exceptionally well-designed, using robust `data-testid` selectors and Playwright's auto-waiting `expect` assertions. However, the API tests (`test_api.py`), which are the source of all failures, are poorly designed. Their assertions are brittle, relying on exact string matches that fail due to insignificant details like CSS classes within tags or differences in character representation (e.g., `'` vs `&#x27;`). This makes them unreliable for validation."

        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The root cause is a pattern of brittle assertions within the API tests (`test_api.py`). The tests make incorrect assumptions about the exact HTML string returned by the server, failing when the server produces functionally identical but textually different HTML. This is not an application bug.",
            "evidence": "Failure 1: The test expects a `<code>` tag with no attributes, but the app correctly includes CSS classes.\n```\nE       assert '<code>/exhibit/impressionism</code>' in '\\n    <h3 ...>Exhibit: Impressionism</h3>\\n    <p ...>... <code class=\"bg-gray-900 px-1 rounded\">/exhibit/impressionism</code>.</p>\\n    '\n```\nFailure 2: The test expects an HTML-encoded single quote (`&#x27;`), but the app correctly returns a literal single quote.\n```\nE       assert 'Success! Sculpture:</span> &#x27;The Thinker&#x27;' in '\\n    ...<span ...>Success! Sculpture:</span> \\'The Thinker\\'</p>...\\n    '\n```"

The tests should be rewritten to be more resilient, for example, by checking for substring containment of the essential text rather than the exact HTML structure."
