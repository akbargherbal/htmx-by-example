      Welcome to the Modern Digital Art Gallery!

        Imagine a traditional website as an old-fashioned museum. To see a new exhibit, you have to exit the building, walk down the street, and enter a completely new one. This is the "full page reload"—a slow, disruptive experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This course reimagines our website as a modern, elegant art gallery. With HTMX, we don't leave the building. Instead, we glide seamlessly from one hall to the next. When you click to view a new exhibit, the lights dim for a moment (an <code class="bg-gray-900 px-1 rounded">hx-indicator</code>), and then the new artwork is revealed right where it should be (<code class="bg-gray-900 px-1 rounded">hx-target</code>). The gallery map in your hand updates to show your new location (<code class="bg-gray-900 px-1 rounded">hx-push-url</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the core of the modern web experience: fast, interactive, and intuitive. Let's learn how to be the architects of this refined digital gallery.
