    "classification": "CASCADE_BUG",

    "summary": "The high test failure rate is caused by two distinct but minor bugs in the application code, not a design flaw or faulty tests. The primary issue is a `jinja2.TemplateSyntaxError` in `index.html` which breaks the root page, causing a cascade failure in the E2E test. A second, independent bug in `main.py` prevents the `HX-Push-Url` header from being set correctly. The tests are well-designed as they successfully pinpoint these specific issues.",

        "design_flaw_analysis": {
            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The foundation of the project is solid. The implemented concept of using HTMX for form submission, dynamic UI updates, and client-side URL pushing (`HX-Push-Url`) is a valid and common educational pattern. The FastAPI backend and Jinja2 frontend are structured logically and coherently."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The tests are of high quality. The API tests correctly use FastAPI's `TestClient` and an `autouse` fixture for state isolation. The E2E test is robust, using `data-testid` selectors and Playwright's `expect` for reliable, non-flaky assertions. The tests are not the problem; they are correctly identifying specific bugs in the application."
        },
        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "There are two primary bugs. The first and most impactful is a Jinja2 template syntax error that causes the root endpoint ('/') to fail with a 500 Internal Server Error. This single bug causes both the root API test and the E2E test to fail immediately. The second bug is in the `/request-book` endpoint, where the `HX-Push-Url` header is set on a `response` object that is then discarded, as a new `HTMLResponse` object is returned instead.",
            "evidence": "Evidence for the template error: `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Unexpected end of template. Jinja was looking for the following tags: 'elif' or 'else' or 'endif'. The innermost block that needs to be closed is 'if'.` Evidence for the header bug: `AssertionError: assert 'HX-Push-Url' in Headers({'content-length': '568', 'content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8'})`."

        "next_step": "FIX_BUGS",
        "justification": "The project's core logic and test suite are both sound. The failures are due to specific, fixable bugs in the application code. Fixing the Jinja2 syntax error in `index.html` and correcting the response handling in the `/request-book` endpoint in `main.py` will resolve all test failures."
