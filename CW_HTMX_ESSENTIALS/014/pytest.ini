[pytest]
# This configuration is essential for making pytest run correctly from the
# project's root directory.
# `pythonpath = .` tells pytest to add the current directory (.) to Python's
# path. This allows our test files (e.g., tests/test_api.py) to successfully
# import modules from our application directory (e.g., `from app.main import app`).
# Without this, you would encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
pythonpath = .
