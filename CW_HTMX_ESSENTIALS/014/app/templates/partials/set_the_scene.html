      Welcome to the The Digital Home Renovation Workshop!
    </h2>
    <div class="text-slate-300 space-y-3">
      <p>
        Think of a modern webpage not as a static painting, but as a room you can dynamically renovate. In this workshop, you're the lead contractor, and HTMX is your powerful set of tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll explore how HTMX attributes act like instructions for your digital crew. You'll see how to install a new window pane (`hx-swap`), go to the hardware store for a full door assembly but only bring back the doorknob (`hx-select`), and provide exact measurements for a custom cabinet (`hx-include`). This hands-on analogy makes abstract concepts tangible, showing you how to update parts of your webpage without having to rebuild the entire room.
