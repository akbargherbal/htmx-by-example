[pytest]
# This configuration is essential for making tests run smoothly.
# `pythonpath = .` tells pytest to add the project's root directory
# to the Python path. This allows our test files in `tests/` to
# use absolute imports like `from app.main import app` without any
# complex path manipulation, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
