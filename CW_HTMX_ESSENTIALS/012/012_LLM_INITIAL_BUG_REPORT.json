    "summary": "The project's application code and test suite are both well-designed and conceptually sound. The test failures are caused by a single, specific issue: the frontend HTMX configuration does not account for non-2xx HTTP responses. The backend correctly sends HTML error fragments with 404 and 500 status codes (as confirmed by passing API tests), but by default, HTMX does not swap content on error responses. This causes the UI to remain unchanged, leading to failures in the two E2E tests designed to verify error handling.",
    "analysis": {
        "design_flaw_analysis": {
            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The core concept of using a 'Post Office' form to demonstrate HTMX form submission, value inclusion, and error handling is solid and well-executed. The FastAPI backend and Jinja2 frontend are implemented cleanly and logically. The educational goal is clearly met by the code."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The tests are of high quality. The API tests correctly use FastAPI's TestClient with specific assertions for status codes and content. The E2E tests exemplify best practices by using `data-testid` selectors for resilience and Playwright's `expect()` for reliable, auto-waiting assertions. The tests accurately model the intended user interactions and expected outcomes."
        },
        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The root cause is that the frontend does not handle non-2xx HTTP responses from HTMX requests. The backend correctly returns 404 and 500 status codes with HTML payloads, but the default HTMX behavior is to not swap this content into the DOM. Consequently, the target div `#mail_status_display` is never updated during error scenarios.",
            "evidence": "The pytest log shows that all API tests pass, including `test_process_invalid_zip_returns_404_error`, proving the backend works. However, the corresponding E2E test fails with: `AssertionError: Locator expected to contain text 'Error: Not Found (404)' Actual value: Awaiting transmission...`. This proves the backend sent the error, but the frontend UI was not updated."

        "next_step": "FIX_BUGS",
        "justification": "The project is fundamentally sound with high-quality tests. A minor fix is required in the `index.html` file to instruct HTMX to process and swap content from non-2xx responses. Once this bug is fixed, the existing E2E tests should pass, validating the entire system correctly."
