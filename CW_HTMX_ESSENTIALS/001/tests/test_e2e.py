# Principal Frontend Engineer Notes:
# This file contains the end-to-end (E2E) tests for the "Personal Chef" application.
# The philosophy here is to test the system from the user's perspective. We don't care
# about the internal implementation of HTMX or FastAPI; we only care that when a user
# clicks a button, the correct final state appears on the screen.

# Key Testing Principles Applied:
# 1.  `live_server` and `page` fixtures are used to provide a running app and a browser.
# 2.  Selectors are ALWAYS `data-testid` attributes. This decouples tests from fragile
#     CSS classes or HTML structure, making them far more robust.
# 3.  Assertions use Playwright's `expect()` for its powerful auto-waiting capabilities,
#     eliminating the need for manual `sleep()` calls.
# 4.  Each test verifies a single, complete user story (e.g., "clicking 'Get Water'
#     results in a water message on the serving plate").
# 5.  Assertions check for the *exact HTML fragments* returned by the backend, ensuring
#     that the frontend is correctly integrating with the true API response.

from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect

# The `live_server` fixture is automatically provided by conftest.py
# The `page` fixture is automatically provided by pytest-playwright.
