### **Tasks Completed in This Session [1]:**

- **Improved UI Ergonomics:** We successfully refactored the `index.html` layout to a responsive two-column design, ensuring the controls and results are visible simultaneously on larger screens without altering the HTML structure.
- **Established an Enhancement Strategy:** We diagnosed the core "thematic" and "pedagogical" gaps in the courseware and decided on a scalable "Overlay & Enhance" strategy using instructional modals.
- **Created a Reusable Automation Script:** We developed `enhance_courseware.py`, a portable and idempotent Python script that programmatically injects the instructional modal system into any given courseware directory.
- **Executed a Successful Test Run:** We ran the enhancement script on courseware `001`, which created the `set_the_scene.html` and `why_behind_what.html` partials and modified `index.html` to use them.
- **Verified No Regressions:** We confirmed via a full `pytest` run that all 10 API and E2E tests passed after the modifications, proving the surgical nature of the script.
- **Prepared for Future Automation:**
  - We created and refined a robust LLM prompt template (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`) to ensure consistent and safe interactions in future sessions.
  - We updated the `course_description.json` file with thematic keywords for all 22 modules to serve as input for future automated processes.

### **Task Remaining (for this courseware):**

- **Apply Thematic Visual Re-skin:** The final step is to use the "Generative Thematic Reskin" LLM prompt we designed to update the visual theme of `index.html`. The goal is to replace the generic dark theme with a new set of Tailwind CSS classes that align with the "Personal Chef & Smart Kitchen" theme, completing the UI enhancement.
