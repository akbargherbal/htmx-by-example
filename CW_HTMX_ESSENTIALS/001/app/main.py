# This file defines the main FastAPI application for the "Personal Chef & Smart Kitchen" demo.

# separating our presentation logic from our application logic.

# --- In-Memory State Management ---

# PRINCIPLE: For this educational project, we avoid databases and external dependencies.
# State is managed in a simple global variable. This is NOT suitable for production
# but is perfect for demonstrating the core HTMX concepts in an isolated way.
