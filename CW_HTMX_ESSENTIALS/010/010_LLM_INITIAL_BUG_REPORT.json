    "classification": "CASCADE_BUG",
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "summary": "The project is conceptually sound and the tests are mostly well-designed, but a specific, minor bug in a single FastAPI endpoint is causing a cascading failure. The `/api/scan-pass` endpoint signature in `main.py` does not correctly map the incoming hyphenated form field name (`ticket-type`) to the Python parameter (`ticket_type`), resulting in a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error. This single backend bug is the direct cause for the failure of both its corresponding API test and the E2E test that verifies the user-facing redirect, making it a classic cascade bug.",

        "design_flaw_analysis": {
            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The core educational concept of an 'Airport Terminal' to demonstrate HTMX real-time updates and navigation is solid, practical, and well-implemented in the code. The codebase is clean and logical. The mismatch with the 'Video Game Inventory' description appears to be a metadata error, not a flaw in the project's design or implementation."

        "test_quality_analysis": {
            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The test suite is of high quality. The API tests correctly use FastAPI's TestClient and fixtures for state isolation. The E2E tests demonstrate best practices by using `data-testid` selectors for robustness and Playwright's `expect()` with auto-waiting to prevent flakiness. The tests accurately model user interactions and correctly assert the expected outcomes. One test (`test_urgent_update_refreshes_departures_board`) contains a minor implementation bug in its assertion logic, but this does not detract from the overall excellent design of the suite."
        },
        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The primary bug is a parameter mapping issue in the `/api/scan-pass` endpoint in `main.py`. The function signature `async def scan_pass(ticket_type: Annotated[str, Form()])` expects a form field named `ticket_type`, but the HTML form submits a field named `ticket-type`. FastAPI fails to map this automatically, leading to a `422 Unprocessable Entity` validation error instead of the expected `200 OK` with a redirect header.",
            "evidence": "The API test fails with `assert 422 == 200`. This backend failure directly causes the E2E test to fail its assertion: `AssertionError: Page URL expected to be 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/access-denied' Actual value: http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. This demonstrates a clear cascade from a backend bug to a frontend test failure."

    "recommendation": {
        "next_step": "FIX_BUGS",
        "justification": "The project's foundation and tests are strong. Fixing the identified parameter alias bug in `main.py` is a minor change that will resolve half of the test failures. The remaining isolated bugs are also minor and can be fixed easily. The project is highly salvageable and valuable."
