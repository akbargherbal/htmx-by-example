    "summary": "A subtle but critical bug in the application's state-resetting utility function is the primary cause of the widespread API test failures. The function incorrectly rebinds a global state variable instead of modifying it in-place. This causes the test suite to manipulate a stale reference to the state dictionary, rendering all test-specific state modifications ineffective. The application logic itself is largely correct, but this single bug causes it to always operate on its initial default state during tests, leading to a cascade of assertion failures. A secondary, distinct issue exists where the E2E tests lack any state reset mechanism, causing test interdependency.",

            "is_flawed": false,
            "justification": "The project's core concept of an ATM simulation is a coherent and logical way to demonstrate the specified HTMX interactions. The application's architecture, using a simple in-memory dictionary for state, is appropriate for the educational scope. The code is clean, well-commented, and the logic within the endpoints correctly reflects the intended 'contract'. There are no signs of hallucinated features or nonsensical design."

            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The tests are fundamentally well-designed, despite their high failure rate. The API tests (`test_api.py`) correctly use FastAPI's `TestClient`, employ fixtures for setup (`reset_state_before_each_test`), and make specific assertions against status codes, response content, and state mutation. The E2E tests (`test_e2e.py`) follow best practices by using `data-testid` selectors for robustness and `expect` for auto-waiting assertions. Their main flaw is the omission of a state-reset step between test runs, which is an implementation error rather than a design flaw."
        },
        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The primary bug is in the `reset_state_for_testing` function within `app/main.py`. The line `APP_STATE = INITIAL_STATE.copy()` rebinds the global name `APP_STATE` to a new dictionary object. The test module (`tests/test_api.py`) imports `APP_STATE` when it's first loaded, holding a reference to the original dictionary. When the test fixture calls the reset function, the application's reference to `APP_STATE` is updated, but the test module's reference is not. Therefore, all subsequent state modifications within the tests (e.g., `APP_STATE['balance'] = 500.00`) are made to a stale, disconnected dictionary, and the application endpoints only ever see the freshly initialized state.",
            "evidence": "The pattern of failures is the key evidence. For example, in `test_login_succeeds_when_card_is_inserted`, the test sets `APP_STATE['card_inserted'] = True` but the assertion fails with `assert 402 == 200`, indicating the application behaved as if the card was not inserted. Similarly, in `test_withdraw_succeeds_with_sufficient_funds`, the test sets the balance to 500 but the failure log shows the resulting balance was calculated from the initial 1000: `assert 'New Balance: $300.00' in '...New Balance: $800.00...'`. This consistently demonstrates that test-side state modifications are being ignored."

        "next_step": "FIX_BUGS",
        "justification": "The project is fundamentally sound and highly salvageable. The primary action is to fix the single-line bug in the `reset_state_for_testing` function to modify the state dictionary in-place (e.g., using `.clear()` and `.update()`). This will resolve the cascade of API test failures. Subsequently, a fixture should be added to the E2E tests to call a state-reset endpoint before each run, ensuring test isolation."
