    "classification": "CASCADE_BUG",
    "confidence_score": 1.0,
    "summary": "The project's high test failure rate is caused by a single, cascading bug in the backend. The `/add-item` endpoint attempts to render an HTML fragment from a template file (`partials/_order_summary.html`) that does not exist in the provided project structure. This results in a `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound` error and a 500 Internal Server Error for all add-item operations. This single point of failure causes all API and E2E tests that rely on this endpoint to fail, while foundational tests that don't touch this endpoint pass, confirming the cascading nature of the issue.",

            "justification": "The core concept of the application (using `hx-post` to update a list on the server and swap the result into the page) is a fundamental and sound pattern for teaching HTMX. The FastAPI backend and Jinja2/HTMX frontend are logically structured and correctly implement this pattern. The educational goal is clear and the implementation is coherent, despite a mismatch with the courseware description."

            "are_tests_well_designed": true,
            "justification": "The tests are of high quality. The API tests (`test_api.py`) correctly use FastAPI's `TestClient`, isolate state with fixtures, and make specific assertions against both the HTTP response and the backend state. The E2E tests (`test_e2e.py`) follow best practices by using `data-testid` for resilient selectors and relying on Playwright's auto-waiting `expect` calls, avoiding fragile sleeps. The test cases logically cover the primary user flows."

        "root_cause_analysis": {
            "identified_bug_or_issue": "The root cause is a `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound` error. The `add_item` endpoint in `app/main.py` attempts to render a partial template from the path `partials/_order_summary.html`. However, this file is not present in the project's `app/templates/` directory. This causes every call to the `/add-item` endpoint to fail with a 500 Internal Server Error.",
            "evidence": "The pytest log consistently shows the following error for all failing API tests and in the server-side logs for all failing E2E tests: `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: 'partials/_order_summary.html' not found in search path: 'app/templates'`. This single error explains all subsequent `AssertionError` failures in the E2E tests, as the UI is never updated due to the server error."

The logical next step is to fix this bug by creating the required `partials/_order_summary.html` template file. This single fix is expected to resolve all 6 test failures."
